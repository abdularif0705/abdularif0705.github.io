You can browse my project section to see some of the things I have created over the years. There are three reasons why I usually start working on a project. One, it seems like an interesting idea; for example, a library website for Hogwarts. I had a blast trying to think of things wizards and witches would find useful on a library website. Two, I am trying to learn some concepts or technology. For example, I created the automated spear-phisher so I could learn more about phishing attacks. Lastly, it something that's inherently useful. An example of this is my Amazon deal finder.",
