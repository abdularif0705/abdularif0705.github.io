You can browse my project section to see some of the things I have created over the years. There are three reasons why I usually start working on a project. One, it seems like an interesting idea; for example, a capture the flag first person shooter created in Unity. I had a blast building different weapons and writing scripts for how the player and guns would interact wit the enviroment. Two, I am trying to learn some concepts or technology. For example, I created a Network IP Manipulator so I could learn more about how to traverse other computers over a LAN. Lastly, it something that's inherently useful. An example of this is my Windsor Traffic Data Analyzer.",
